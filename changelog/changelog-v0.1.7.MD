## A Pleasant Day Alpha v0.1.7

### Goals of this update

-   Increase the usefulness and life in the ocean
-   Increase ambience and visuals of snow biomes

### Next Update Goals

-   With the ocean done, that is a majority of aboveground\
changes that can be made for now. The next update will focus\
on tying up a few loose ends, giving Pillagers and Illagers\
a small revamp and the final smaller additions to biomes\
that don't have a lot that can be done to them.
