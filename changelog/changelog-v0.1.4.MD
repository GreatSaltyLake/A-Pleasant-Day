### v0.2.0 Plans

The goal of the first major update will be the vast majority of overworld generation, structures and ambience\
being finished. Updates to follow will continue to add depth to current vanilla biomes and caves. Smaller core\
mods that fit into these biomes will be added as needed, as found or if they are likely to be affected by the addition\
of specific mods. The big change for v0.2.0 will be the first edition of the starting quests. The Tropicraft dimension\
currently still needs a bit of work to feel "finished" by my standards; however, the addition of the previous\
and following mods have mildily tweaked the feel of it and I'll be coming back to it to sharpen loose ends\
once I see how the next few updates affects it.
