## A Pleasant Day Alpha v0.2.1

### Goals of this update

To alter some unwanted mods and shift towards a different direction in questing. Will be attempting
various questing mods for the starting dimension until something eventually clicks. 

### Next major goals

The next update will involve getting a baseline of mods ready for the Nether.
I've not yet decided if I want to hardlock the Nether behind another dimension
or not at this time; however, that will be decided by release of v0.2.2. Not much
will be touched with the mod - it will merely be added to ensure not comptability. 
v0.3.0 goals will be essentially be some content mods being added, nether done,
if another dimension is added it mostly be prepped and quests to lead players 
to/through these dimensions.
