## A Pleasant Day Alpha v0.1.9

### Goals of this update

- Revamp caves to feel new and different
- Revamp dungeons and mobs
- Further QoL and small addition mods
- Add additional "core" mods relating to pack theme and progression 

### v0.2.0 talks

- I combined what should have been v0.1.10 and v0.9.0 as it would have left
v0.9.0 in an odd state. This update pulled major changes to prep for v0.2.0
in that Terralith was removed. Terralith has a LOT of incomptabilities with
other mods that alter world gen. It has been replaced with WWOO, Tectonic,
OTBWG and Mystic's Biomes. This offers equally as stunning world gen and 
overall caters far beter to the fantasy theme of the pack. Tropicraft has
also been removed. A major memory leak between it and Tectonic was found
that does not appear to be fixable on my end. The Undergarden has replaced
it as the starting dimension and is overall a far more polished mod that
requires less work to intergrate into the pack. v0.2.0 goals remain in
place to add quests, make any polishing changes to the dimension and 
begin to make the pack feel less alpha.
