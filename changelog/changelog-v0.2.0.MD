## A Pleasant Day Alpha v0.2.0

### Goals of this update

- Add starting quests along with tutorial quests
- Refine many aspects of currently added mods 
- Refine The Undergarden and ensure players adequately progress
- Add the start of the story the pack was influenced by

### Next major goals

v0.3.0 could go in a few directions and I'll be busy over the next week
to do any work on the pack. The End and Nether both needs worked, the 
decision whether a dimension is added before Nether or not is needed
and content mods are all under consideration to be the main focus.
Updates to come!
