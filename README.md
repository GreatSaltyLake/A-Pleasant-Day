# A Pleasant Day v1.20.1 Minecraft Modpack

```diff
- Modpack is being put on the backburner until other mods I would like to be apart of the core gameplay are updated. I'll likely be moving towards making a small 1.21 pack in the meantime. 
```

Welcome to my Minecraft modpack A Pleasant Day! The name is related to an early mission in a popular video game series and relates to the start of the your journey here.

The pack is in VERY early Alpha. There are only mild differences to that of a vanilla world and there WILL be bugs and updates that require full world restarts. This is for my own convenience to have easy access to previous versions without digging through the github. Once I consider it to be in a playable state; I'll advertise a "stable" alpha playtest version. 

Planned additions and more info relating to the pack theme to come soon!
